# Expense-Tracker-React
An elegant, voice-controlled expense tracker powered by React, Material UI and Speechly

## Introduction

This complex Expense Budget Tracker is built using reactJS with concepts like

1. State Management using ReactHooks like useReducer, useState
1. Context API for global State management
1. Custom hooks

It uses Material UI Framework for styling and Local Storage.
Most importantly, I've added voice capabilities to this application using Speechly.
